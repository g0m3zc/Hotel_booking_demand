# Hotel_booking_demand

**Context**:  
Cancelations are an important aspect to any sales process.  In this project we will review canceled reservations for hotels in Portugal in efforts to better understand trends and areas for opportunity.


**Objective**:  
Analyze trends in features related to hotel reservation cancelations.  Create a classification model that is able to determine which reservations are more likely to cancel.

**Cancelation Trends**

- Further business review may be completed to better understand cancelation trends and position offerings in areas such as:

  - Dining options:
    Full board meal plans are more likely to cancel.  Offering alternative plans or improving offers in this area may help improve retention rate.

  - Repeat customers:
    Repeat customers have a lower cancelation rate, and customers who have canceled before have higher rates of canceling again.  Efforts to increase repeat customers may be advantageous due to their higher retention rates.

  - Reservations from other countries:
    Marketing efforts to gain reservations from international customers may have a higher return on investment than customers from the same country.

- Classification model predicts cancelation rate with 80% precision and 75% recall.  Model can be used to identify reservations which are predicted to cancel for potential proactive action.
